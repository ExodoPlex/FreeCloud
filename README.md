# freecloud
Open source, user friendly, self-hosted cloud solution

The idea is to replace the Synology DSM with a completely open source solution. 

Pillar principles are user friendliness first. Functions and security must be presented to the user in the least confusing and most useful way, if it's necessary to present it to the customer at all. End result should be full feature parity with the consumer features of Synology DSM, yet with zero proprietary code, zero "cloud login", and 100% user control over their own data. NO TELEMTRY or binary blobs beyond what is absolutely required for basic functionality.

This can be accomplished using linux and GNU projects as the back end services. Then coding front end web and mobile apps as the user interface to those systems.

I realize NextCloud/OwnCloud and FreeNAS are a thing. But, they don't have anywhere near the feature set nor ease of use that Synology DSM has.

My goal with this project is to help people escape big data. I want this project to replace every cloud service the average person is using with something just as useful and convenient. But, with open source code and 100% user control over what their system is doing with their data. Think Linux philosophy on a NAS box.
